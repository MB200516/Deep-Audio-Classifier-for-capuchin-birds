# Deep-Audio-Classification
Description: Leveraging advanced audio processing and machine learning techniques to analyze forest audio files. The primary focus is on identifying areas with the highest density of Capuchin bird calls.

Key Points
- Machine Learning and Computer Vision: Constructing a robust TensorFlow-based CNN for precise Capuchin bird call classification with an accuracy of ~97%, providing binary output (1 or 0) for their presence or absence. Integrating Computer Vision techniques enhances accuracy and interpretability.
- Audio Analysis: Segmenting 3–4 minute audio clips into 3-second windows for detailed analysis. Applying the trained Neural Network to each segment efficiently identifies Capuchin bird calls.
- Spectrogram Visualization: Transforming waveform data into spectrograms enables visualizing and understanding audio frequencies over time.

- Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Computer Vision techniques, Deep Learning
- Imapct: Automating forest audio analysis contributes to environmental monitoring. Identifying areas with high Capuchin bird density aids biodiversity and ecosystem health assessment. The project informs efficient conservation strategies, fostering a balance between nature and human activities.
